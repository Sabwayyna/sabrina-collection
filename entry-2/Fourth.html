			In the final subpart, the personal imageries have transformed into a darkened, chaotic, and ghostly impressions of the past. 
			Elements of the collage are barely recognizable, resembling the once-vivid moments.

			It's a disconcerting sensation: The discomfort of knowing that a significant part of my life is now 'missing' is palpable. 
			This subpart leaves the viewer with a poignant reflection on the transitory nature of life and the poignant complexity of nostalgia,
				 where the act of remembering is intricately tied to the inevitability of forgetting.

			This concluding art piece serves as a visual encapsulation of the chaos and gradual fading of my childhood memories, 
			an embodiment of the transformation that has unfolded over the years.
			 As I approach my 19th birthday, it becomes increasingly evident that my childhood, once vivid and familiar, 
			 	has evolved into an environment I seldom revisit. 
			The memories are now obscure, fragmented, and, in some instances, entirely forgotten.

		Conclusion 
		</div>
		<div class="quote-text">
			This artistic journey transports me back to my early days in China, 
				a time before the borders of my existence expanded to encompass the Canadian landscape. 
			Shanxi, a small town, is the backdrop to these recollections, 
				where everything seems to have been preserved as a hazy, dream-like montage. 
			Whether within the four walls of a classroom, the confines of my bedroom, 
				or the rustic charm of the neighborhood park, these memories are endowed with a certain indistinct quality.

		Nostalgia, for me, has always been an enigmatic emotion, characterized by a delicate equilibrium of sweetness and melancholy.
		 It hints at a discomforting sense of the unknown, fostering an air of mystery that has long intrigued me. 
		 It is precisely this beguiling sentiment that I aspire to encapsulate through the medium of collage, 
		 	a format that, by its very nature, involves layering.

		My objective is not only to capture my own experiences and emotions about how I feel about "nostalgia",
			but to extend an invitation to viewers on a shared exploration of mystifying and complicated feeling of nostalgia.
