			In this subpart, the personal imageries take on an even more dreamlike quality. 
			The images become fragmented, dissolving into mere fragments of the past. 
			Here, the discomfort intensifies as the memories become increasingly elusive. 
			The sense of 'missing' becomes undeniable. 
			These fragmented memories are like puzzle pieces scattered by the relentless march of time, 
				leaving a profound yearning for what was once whole.

			As this page shows the more extreme side of my change, the faces are cut out, 
			and empty in replacement of the complicated background. Buildings are sliced in half, 
			representing my dissociation to what I call "home."
