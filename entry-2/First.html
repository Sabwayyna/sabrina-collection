				Nostalgia Origin

			In my previous entry, I touched upon a pivotal chapter in my life's narrative: the end of my years in a Chinese environment, marked by my move to Canada at the age of seven.

			What it Means to Me 
		</div>
		<div class="quote-text">
			With a desire to articulate the complex and often bittersweet emotions associated with nostalgia, I have chosen the medium of art as a means of expression. 
			In particular, I intend to explore the subtle interplay of surrealism to craft imagery that is both unsettling and deeply evocative of the tendrils of nostalgia that thread through my memories.

			<div class="quote-text">
				Here, I aim to capture a vivid, unadulterated memory of those early days - a memory that remains strikingly clear despite the passage of time. 
				It serves as a window into my past, revealing the innocence, wonder, and simplicity of my life in Shanxi in a momment in a classroom.

					The addition of personal imagery below the focal image  encapsulates a unique facet of my past in China. 
				However, in next pages of the series, you will see the gradual fading and disorietation of these charaterstics that makes up the collage.
